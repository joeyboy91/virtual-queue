# Virtual Queue

- Simple Smart Contract
- Initializes with a Manager
- Manager assigns Stores
- User registers to the System.
- System allots store queue order in FIFO.
- User in _Active-Queue_ is served and makes room for User from _Waiting-Queue_.

note: This is just a no-brainer and cannot be considered as a serious project.
